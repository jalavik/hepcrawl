    """BASE crawler
    Scrapes BASE metadata XML files one at a time. 
    The actual files should be retrieved from BASE viat its OAI interface. 

    This spider takes one BASE metadata record which are stored in an XML file.

    1. First it looks through the file and determines if it has a direct link to a fulltext pdf. 
       (Actually it doesn't recognize fulltexts; it's happy when it sees a pdf of some kind.)
       calls: parse_node()

    2. If no direct link exists, it scrapes the urls it found and tries to find a direct pdf 
       link using scrape_for_pdf(). Whatever happens, it will then call parse_node() again 
       and goes through the XML file and extracts all the desired data.
       calls: scrape_for_pdf()

    3. parse_node() will be called a second time and after parsing it will return a HEPrecord Item().
       That item will be put trough a JSON writer pipeline.
       calls: parse_node() again, then sends to processing pipeline.
       
    Duplicate requests filters have been manually disabled for us to be able to call 
    parse_node() twice: 
    'DUPEFILTER_CLASS' : 'scrapy.dupefilters.BaseDupeFilter'
    Better way to do this??


    Example usage:
    scrapy crawl BASE -a source_file=file://`pwd`/tests/responses/base/test_record1_no_namespaces.xml -s "JSON_OUTPUT_DIR=tmp/"
    
    TODO:
    *Namespaces not working, namespace removal not working. Test case has been stripped of namespaces manually :|
    *Should the spider also access the BASE OAI interface and retrieve the XMLs?
     Now it's assumed that the XMLs are already in place in some local directory.
    *When should the pdf page numbers be counted? Maybe it's not sensible to do it here. 
    *Why is the JSON pipeline not writing unicode?
    *Some Items missing
    *Needs more testing with different XML files!


    Happy crawling!
