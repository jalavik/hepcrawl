        "In heavy-ion induced fusion-fission reactions, the angular distribution of fission "
        "fragments is sensitive to the mean square angular momentum brought in by the fusion "
        "process, and the nuclear shape and temperature at the fission saddle point. "
        "Experimental fission fragment angular distributions are often used to infer "
        "one or more of these properties. Historically the analysis of these distributions "
        "has re­ lied on the alignment of the total angular momentum J of the compound nucleus"
        ", perpendicular to the projectile velocity. A full theoretical approach, written into "
        "a computer code for the first time, allows the effect of ground-state spin of the "
        "projectile and target nuclei to be correctly treated. This approach takes into account "
        "the change in alignment of J due to the inclusion of this spin, an effect which is shown "
        "to be markedly stronger if the nucleus with appreciable spin also has a strong quadrupole "
        "deformation. This change in alignment of J results in a much reduced fission fragment anisotropy. "
        "In extreme cases, the anisotropy may be below unity, and it ceases to be sufficient to "
        "characterise the fission fragment angular distribution. The calculations have been tested "
        "experimentally, by measuring fission and sur­ vival cross-sections and fission fragment angular "
        "distributions for the four reactions 31P+175,176Lu and 28.29 Si+178Hf, where 176Lu is a "
        "strongly-deformed nucleus with an intrinsic spin of 7 units, and 178Hf has very similar "
        "deformation, but zero spin. The reactions form the compound nuclei 206.207Rn. The total "
        "fusion excitation func­ tions are well-reproduced by calculations, but the fission fragment "
        "anisotropies are reproduced only when the nuclear spin and deformation are taken into account, "
        "con­ firming the theory and supporting the recent understanding of the role of nuclear "
        "deformation in the fusion process and of compound nucleus angular momentum in the fission "
        "process. Having established the effect in the well-understood fusion-fission reactions, the "
        "effect of nuclear spin is examined for the less well understood quasi-fission reaction. "
        "Experiments were performed to measure fission cross-sections and fission fragment angular "
        "distributions for the reactions 16O+235,238U, where 235U has a spin of 7/2 and 238U has a "
        "spin of zero. Both nuclei are quadrupole-deformed, and 160+238U was already known to exhibit "
        "evidence for quasi-fission. Theoretical calculations indicate that the fitted anisotropy is "
        "sensitive to the range of angles over which the angular distribution is measured, showing "
        "that where quasi-fission is present, the anisotropy is not sufficient to entirely characterise "
        "the fission fragment angular dis­ tribution. Comparison of the measured anisotropies with "
        "fusion-fission calculations shows clearly that the reaction is quasi-fission dominated. "
        "However, although exist­ ing quasi-fission models predict a strong effect from the spin of "
        "235U, it is shown that the observed effect is appreciably stronger still in the experimental "
        "angular range. This should be an important tool in evaluating future models of the quasi-fission process."
